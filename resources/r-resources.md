## Additional Resources for Learning and Practicing R

There's a multitude of resources for learning R out there. So many, in fact, that it can be overwhelming! Here is a list of some of the resources that we like. It is by no means complete or exhaustive! If you have more that you find helpful, please share them with us by sending us an email. And remember, the best way to learn and practice is to have a data set that you need to clean, visualize, and analyze. Each data set presents unique problems to solve, and that will give you opportunities to use R to solve them!


### R Workshops and Bootcamps
* D-Lab: https://dlab.berkeley.edu/ &rarr D-Lab is a Berkeley's center for all things data, including resources, professional development, and assistance. They offer trainings in a variety of technical skills, including R and Python. They offer frequent workshops (sign up for their newsletter for updates), and they also post all of their materials on GitHub: https://github.com/dlab-berkeley. They have a variety of levels of workshops on R, including:
  * R Fundamentals: Parts 1-4 (no prior knowledge assumed)
  * R Data Wrangling and Manipulation
  * R Visualization

* Berkeley Psych's Fall R Workshop (QuACK; Fall 2020): https://ucb-psychology-quack.github.io/UCB-Psych-QuACK.github.io/ &rarr Semester-long and more extensive intro to R workshop taught by Willa and Elena for first-year PhD students in the department

* University of Oregon Psych Department's R Bootcamp: https://uopsych-r-bootcamp-2020.netlify.app/


### Books and Guides
* A Pirates Guide to R: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/
* Learning Stats with R by Dani Navarro: https://learningstatisticswithr.com/
* R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/


### Tidyverse and ggplot2 Resources
* Tidyverse Style Guide: https://style.tidyverse.org/
* ggplot Book: https://ggplot2-book.org/
* ggplot Flipbook: https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1
  * Cool flipbook where as you scroll, you add layers onto your ggplot: code on the left and plot on the right to see how when you add lines of code your plot changes
  * *Note*: Code is not necessarily in the order generally used, but in an order to show how the plots are built up and what each line does
* See Tidyverse's *learn* page for more: https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/


### R "Cheat Sheets"
* Data wrangling with dplyr and tidyr: https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf
* Data visualization with ggplot: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf
