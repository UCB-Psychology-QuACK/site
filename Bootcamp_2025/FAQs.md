## Summer Bootcamp FAQs
#### 1) How much experience with programming, R, data, or statistics is expected?

No experience is expected or required! We are going to build up the foundational skills you need to work with data in R. If you do have some past experience with R, this workshop will give you the chance to brush up on your skills and learn to apply them to real data. The goal is to give you the tools (and confidence!) to continue learning in your lab, on your own, through [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home), and/or through other online tools. We will also share additional resources so you can keep learning R on your own.

We will not be teaching any statistics in this workshop. However, this course will set you up nicely for a statistics course by giving you hands-on experience working with real data in R and doing the steps leading up data analysis. 


#### 2) Iâ€™m not sure I can attend at this time. Will the sessions be recorded?


No, unfortunately sessions will not be recorded this year. If you have to miss a session, you can look at the materials from that week, but we recommend coming every week. The sessions are interactive and involve hands-on practice with real data. We also hope that this is a community-building experience and will be a great way for you to meet other people in the department.

#### 3) Do the sessions build on one another?
Yes they do! If you are not able to attend a session one week, we encourage you to catch up by completing the practice in order to get the most out of the next session. Again, we encourage everyone to attend all the sessions if possible.

#### 4) Is it too late to join? 
No! Send us an [email](mailto:victoria_keating@berkeley.edu) and we will add you to our listerv.
